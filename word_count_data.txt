Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large-scale data across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It comprises two main components: the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for storage and the MapReduce programming model for processing. HDFS breaks data into chunks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance. MapReduce processes data by dividing tasks into smaller sub-tasks, assigning them to nodes, and consolidating the results. Hadoop's scalability allows for handling massive datasets and enables parallel processing, speeding up computations significantly. Beyond MapReduce, Hadoop's ecosystem includes various tools like Hive for data warehousing, Pig for data analysis, and Spark for in-memory processing, providing a robust ecosystem for diverse data operations. Its flexibility and ability to work with different data types make it a cornerstone in big data analytics and storage solutions.
